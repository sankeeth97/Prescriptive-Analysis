way to acquire more space. They have identified 4 alternative options; either extend their current
warehouse or purchase space in either the city centre, a suburb or in shared warehouses. They have
also identified 5 key criteria; public transport links, ease of parking, layout of the warehouse space,
security and purchase cost.
